# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This project illustrates the success, and failure, of plays and musicals funded by Kickstarter campaigns, primarily in the US and Great Britain. 
For this project I was asked to look at data points of Kickstarter campaigns, specifically for theatrical plays, to discover a link between factors that led to their success and likewise, failure (and cancellation). For this I was asked to look at two factors, the first being what time of year the Kickstarter campaign was launched, and the second being how much money was asked per goal.

In this chart, Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date, I’ve plotted the amount of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns for theatrical plays. As you can see, the highest amount of successful campaigns were launched in May, with small spikes in February and October. I do think it’s important to note that May had a higher overall number of launches in total, 166 total of which 111 were successful. It’s not immediately clear from the data why May was the best month.

The next chart, Outcomes Based on Goals, shows outcomes based on the goal of the Kickstarter.

As you can see from the accompanying data, the campaigns with the lowest goals, i.e. the “$4999 and less” range were the most successful with a success rate of 73-76%. This drops to a success rate of 55% by the next data point. The next most significant drop in success rate is at the $2500 to 29999 rate with only a 20% success rate. I think it’s clear enough to infer that the ideal budget is no higher than $15000.
In summary, we can see that May would be the best month to launch a Kickstarter for plays but the budget should be kept at or below $15000 to insure a higher chance of success. I would recommend looking more closely at the data by countries as well as what makes May such a successful month for Kickstarter plays.
